DDD had not really been touched since 2007.  This is a light
modification to fit with the current structure of DDS as of v2.8.

The code has been modified lightly to compile with the same
compilers in the same way as the main program.  The set-up with
Makefiles in a directory is the same.  The code is now compiled
against the DLL and is not linked directly with the DDS code.

Note that DDD only calls SolveBoard() and no other DDS functions.
Especially for calculating the DD table for all 20 combinations 
of declarer and strain, there are now much better functions
available.

DDD does not make use of the batch processing capability in DDS,
as it probably didn't exist with DDD was written.

DDD enables the user to walk the DD "tree" interactively.
At least when walking "downwards" towards fewer cards, the
AnalysePlay() functions can be used.  There are excellent
visualization tools available, including DDS Captain, that do
this in a graphical way.

Overall, the code would need a fair amount of work to be a good
demonstrator of DDS as of v2.8.  Look in the examples directory
for programs that test the individual functions.
